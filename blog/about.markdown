I'm currently working towards my MSc in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/en/">Unniveristy of Vienna</a> in Austria. Before that I was a freelancer for three-ish years where I worked mostly with the Go programming
language and Cloud technologies. Furthermore I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science back in 2019 from the <a href="https://www.uniza.sk/index.php/en/">Univerity of Zilina</a> in Slovakia.

 I'm particularly interested in the Go and Rust programming languages and currently I'm shifting my focus towards Cryptography and Security as I think these are becoming more and more important. Most of the projects I work on in my free time are open sourced,
 though occasionally I also work on private projects which never see the light. You can find me on various social networks which are listed at the bottom of the page.
